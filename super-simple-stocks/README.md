SuperSimpleStocks application
-------------

####  Architecture
The implementation of this solution is based on a service interface that provides the functionalities requested to the user. The back-end is based on a data-manager interface accessible from the service implementation. The objects modelled are pojos (plain old java objects) of "Stock" and "Trade".

The framework used is Spring, configured using ApplicationConfig and annotations.

 **Service **
The Service interface "SuperSimpleStocksService" provides the functionalities requested:
 - dividendYield(Symbol symbol, double price)  
 - priceEarningsRatio(SymbolinsTrade(Trade trade)
 - volumeWeightedStockPrice(Symbol symbol, int minutes)
 - gbceAllShareIndex()

 **Data**
 The interface "DataManager" provides the data access and data management:
- insTrade(Trade trade) throws Exception;
- getTradeList();
- getTradeList(Symbol symbol, int minutes) throws Exception;;
- getStockMap();
- getStockBySymbol(Symbol symbol);

> **Note:** Symbol is the Stock Symbol used as Stock id

####  Assunptions

####  Test

####  Execution
SuperSimpleStocks  is a maven project, you can import into Eclipse as a maven project. 

Using the command

maven will compile and will execute the test provided just for the SuperSimpleStocksService. Other tests used for the development will be ignored. 

####  Documentation
[JavaDoc](https://github.com/fabriziozandonella/super-simple-stocks/tree/master/SuperSimpleStocks/doc) 

####  Future developments
Convertion of the project as a Microservice, providing: 
a RESTful API,
